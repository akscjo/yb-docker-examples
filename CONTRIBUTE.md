# Contributing to yb-docker-examples
The YugabyteDB community welcomes anyone that wants to help out in any way, whether that includes reporting problems, helping with documentation, or contributing code changes to fix bugs, add tests, or implement new features. This document outlines the basic steps required to work with and contribute to the yb-docker-examples codebase.

## Install the tools

The following software is required to work with the Debezium codebase and build it locally:

* [Git 2.2.1](https://git-scm.com) or later
* [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) or [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) 1.9 or later

See the links above for installation instructions on your platform. You can verify the versions are installed and running:

    $ git --version
    $ javac -version
    $ mvn -version
    $ docker --version

### GitHub account

yb-docker-examples uses [GitHub](GitHub.com) for its primary code repository and for pull-requests, so if you don't already have a GitHub account you'll need to [join](https://github.com/join).
